- 👋 Hi, I’m @TyTodd and I'm interested in robotics🤖, computer science💻, mechanical engineering⚙️, and entrepreneurship🤝.
- 👀 I would love to work on a project that uses engineering solutions to solve some of the worlds toughest problems such as climate change 
- 👏 I would also be interested in a project that makes STEM education more accesible to underpriviliged children.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about machine learning and PyTorch. So if you have any good resources reach out.
